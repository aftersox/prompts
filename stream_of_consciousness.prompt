Below are two parts. One a possible summary, if there's not a summary it will say "none". 
Second is a stream of consciousness. I recorded myself speaking on a topic or many topics. 
Your task is to write a brief paragraph summarizing the topic, and then an outline of the main points that were in the text.

### Summary
