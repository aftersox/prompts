Below are two parts. 
One: a summary of the previous text (if any), if there's not a summary it will say "none". 
Two: is a stream of consciousness. I recorded myself speaking on a topic or many topics. 
Your task is to write two things: 1) a brief paragraph summarizing the topic, and then 2) an outline using bullet points of the main points that were in the text.

### Summary

none

### Stream
